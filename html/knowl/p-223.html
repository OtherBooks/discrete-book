The answer is not 37, even though the sum of the numbers above is 37. For example, while 12 students failed Algebra, 2 of those students also failed Biology, 6 also failed Chemestry, and 1 of those failed all three subjects. In fact, that 1 student who failed all three subjects is counted a total of 7 times in the total 37. To clarify things, let us think of the students who failed Algebra as the elements of the set \(A\), and similarly for sets \(B\) and \(C\). The one student who failed all three subjects is the lone element of the set \(A \cap B \cap C\). Thus, in Venn diagrams:
