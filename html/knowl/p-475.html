Answer 2: Break this up into cases by what the “middle” (third smallest) element of the 5 element subset is. The smallest this could be is a 3. In that case, we have \({2 \choose 2}\) choices for the numbers below it, and \({n \choose 2}\) choices for the numbers above it. Alternatively, the middle number could be a 4. In this case there are \({3 \choose 2}\) choices for the bottom two numbers and \({n-1 \choose 2}\) choices for the top two numbers. If the middle number is 5, then there are \({4 \choose 2}\) choices for the bottom two numbers and \({n-2 \choose 2}\) choices for the top two numbers. An so on, all the way up to the largest the middle number could be, which is \(n+1\). In that case there are \({n \choose 2}\) choices for the bottom two numbers and \({2 \choose 2}\) choices for the top number. Thus the number of 5 element subsets is.
\begin{equation*}
  {2 \choose 2}{n \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}{n-1 \choose 2} + {4\choose 2}{n-2 \choose 2} + \cdots + {n\choose 2}{2\choose 2}.
\end{equation*}
