</h5>We answer the question of how many length \(n\) ternary digit strings there are in two ways.  First, each digit can be one of three choices, so the total number of strings is \(3^n\).  On the other hand, we could break the question down into cases by how many of the digits are 2's.  If they are all 2's, then there are \({n \choose 0}\) strings.  If all but one is a 2, then there are \(2{n \choose 1}\) strings.  If all but 2 of the digits are 2's, then there are \(2^2{n \choose 2}\) strings.  We choose 2 of the \(n\) digits to be non-2, and then there are 2 choices for each of those digits.  And so on for every possible number of 2's in the string.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_comb-proofs.html#li-345">in-context</a></span>
