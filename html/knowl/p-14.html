In Spring 2015, Alees Seehausen, a graduate student at the University of Northern Colorado, co-taught the Discrete Mathematics course with me and helped develop many of the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Investigate!</em> activities and other problems currently used in the text. She also offered many suggestions for improvement of the expository text, for which I am quite grateful. Thanks also to Katie Morrison and Nate Eldredge for their suggestions after using parts of this text in their class.
