In a recent survey, 30 students reported whether they liked their potatoes Mashed, French-fried, or Twice-baked. 15 liked them mashed, 20 liked French fries, and 9 liked twice baked potatoes. Additionally, 12 students liked both mashed and fried potatoes, 5 liked French fries and twice baked potatoes, 6 liked mashed and baked, and 3 liked all three styles. How many students

Using the principle of inclusion/exclusion, the number of students who like their potatoes in at least one of the ways described is
\begin{equation*}
  15 + 20 + 9 - 12 - 5 - 6 + 3 = 24.
\end{equation*}

<p id="p-681">
Therefore there are \(30-24 = 6\) students who do not like potatoes. You can also do this problem with a Venn diagram.

If you consider the factorization of any divisor of 735000 it must have at most three 2s, at most one 3, at most four 5s and at most two 7s, with no other prime factors. Thus to select a divisor, we just need to pick how many of these prime factors are present. There are 4 choices for how many 2s to include (between zero and four), 2 choices for how many 3s, 5 choices for how many 5s and 3 choices for how many 7s. Thus the number of divisors is:
\begin{equation*}
  4\cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 120
\end{equation*}
