The question is how many ways can you select one of \(x\) fezzes and one of \(y\) bow ties. We answer this question in two ways. First, the answer could be \(a\cdot b\). This is correct as described in part (a) above. Second, the answer could be \({x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2}\). This is correct as described in part (b) above. Therefore
\begin{equation*}
  {x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2} = xy
\end{equation*}
