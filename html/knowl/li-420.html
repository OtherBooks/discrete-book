</h5>There are \(4^5\) functions all together; we will subtract the functions which are not surjective.  We could exclude any one of the four elements of the codomain, and doing so will leave us with \(3^5\) functions for each excluded element.  This counts too many so we subtract the functions which exclude two of the four elements of the codomain, each pair giving \(2^5\) functions.  But this excludes too many, so we add back in the functions which exclude three of the four elements of the codomain, each triple giving \(1^5\) function.  There are \({4 \choose 1}\) groups of functions excluding a single element, \({4 \choose 2}\) groups of functions excluding a pair of elements, and \({4 \choose 3}\) groups of functions excluding a triple of elements.  This means that the number of functions which are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> surjective is:
\begin{equation*}
  {4 \choose 1}3^5 - {4 \choose 2}2^5 + {4 \choose 3}1^5.
\end{equation*}
We can now say that the number of functions which are surjective is:
\begin{equation*}
  4^5 - \left[{4 \choose 1}3^5 - {4 \choose 2}2^5 + {4 \choose 3}1^5\right].
