Suppose you own \(x\) fezzes and \(y\) bow ties. Of course, \(x\) and \(y\) are both greater than 1.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-597">How many combinations of fez and bow tie can you make?  You can wear only one fez and one bow tie at a time.  Explain.

You have \(x\) choices for the fez, and for each choice of fez you have \(y\) choices for the bow tie. Thus you have \(x \cdot y\) choices for fez and bow tie combination.
</p></div></span>
</li>
<li id="li-598">Explain why the answer is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>also</em>\({x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2}\).  (If this is what you claimed the answer was in part (a), try it again.)

Line up all \(x+y\) quirky clothing items - the \(x\) fezzes and \(y\) bow ties. Now pick 2 of them. This can be done in \({x+y \choose 2}\) ways. However, we might have picked 2 fezzes, which is not allowed. There are \({x \choose 2}\) ways to pick 2 fezzes. Similarly, the \({x+y \choose 2}\) ways to pick two items includes \({y \choose 2}\) ways to select 2 bow ties, also not allowed. Thus the total number of ways to pick a fez and a bow ties is
\begin{equation*}
  {x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2}
\end{equation*}

The question is how many ways can you select one of \(x\) fezzes and one of \(y\) bow ties. We answer this question in two ways. First, the answer could be \(a\cdot b\). This is correct as described in part (a) above. Second, the answer could be \({x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2}\). This is correct as described in part (b) above. Therefore
\begin{equation*}
  {x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2} = xy
\end{equation*}
