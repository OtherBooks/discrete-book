Here is another way to get the answer to the problem above. Start by just adding \(|A| + |B|\). This is \(10 + 8 = 18\), which would be the answer if \(|A \cap B| = 0\). We see that we are off by exactly 6, which just so happens to be \(|A \cap B|\). So perhaps we guess,
\begin{equation*}
  |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|.
\end{equation*}
