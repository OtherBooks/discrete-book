</h5>6, 10, 18, 34, 66, …. To get from one term to the next, we almost double each term.  So maybe we can relate this back to \(2^n\). Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2.  So we get \(2^{n+1} + 2\) (the \(n+1\) is because the first term is 2 more than \(2^2\), not \(2^1\)).  Alternatively, we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, … we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence (omitting the 2).  That sequence had closed formula \(2^{n-1} + 1\).  To make the 3 first, we would write \(2^{n} + 1\).  Our sequence would be twice this, so \(2(2^n + 1)\), which is the same as we got before.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_seq_basics.html#li-651">in-context</a></span>
