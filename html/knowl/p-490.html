While we are at it, we can also answer a related question: how many ways are there to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids so that each kid gets at least one cookie? What can you say about the corresponding stars and bars charts? The charts must start and end with at least one star (so that kids A and D) get cookies, and also no two bars can be adjacent (so that kids B and C are not skipped). One way to assure this is to only place bars in the spaces <!--Style me with CSS--><em>between</em> the stars. With 7 stars, there are 6 spots between the stars, so we must choose 3 of those 6 spots to fill with bars. Thus there are \({6 \choose 3}\) ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids giving at least one cookie to each kid.
