Another way we might represent outcomes is to write a string of seven letters:
\begin{equation*}
  \mbox{ABAADCD} ,
\end{equation*}
which represents that the first cookie goes to kid A, the second cookie goes to kid B, the third and fourth cookies go to kid A, and so on. In fact, this outcome is identical to the previous one â€“ A gets 3 cookies, B and C get 1 each and D gets 2. Each of the seven letters in the string can be any of the 4 possible letters (one for each kid), but the number of such strings is not \(4^7\), because here order does <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> matter. In fact, another way to write the same outcome is
\begin{equation*}
  \mbox{AAABCDD} .
\end{equation*}
