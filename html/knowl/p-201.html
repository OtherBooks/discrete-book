This hardly needs a proof. To find \(A \cup B\), you take everything in \(A\) and throw in everything in \(B\). Since there is no element in both sets already, you will have \(|A|\) things and add \(|B|\) new things to it. This is what adding does! Of course, we can easily extend this to any number of disjoint sets.
