The easiest way to see this is to consider bit strings. \({n \choose k}\) is the number of bit strings of length \(n\) containing \(k\) 1's. Of all of these strings, some start with a 1 and the rest start with a 0. First consider all the bit strings which start with a 1. After the 1, there must be \(n-1\) more bits (to get the total length up to \(n\)) and exactly \(k-1\) of them must be 1's (as we already have one, and we need \(k\) total). How many strings are there like that? There are exactly \({n-1 \choose k-1}\) such bit strings, so of all the length \(n\) bit strings containing \(k\) 1's, \({n-1 \choose k-1}\) of them start with a 1. Similarly, there are \({n-1\choose k}\) which start with a 0 (we still need \(n-1\) bits and now \(k\) of them must be 1's). Since there are \({n-1 \choose k}\) bit strings containing \(n-1\) bits with \(k\) 1's, that is the number of length \(n\) bit strings with \(k\) 1's which start with a 0.
