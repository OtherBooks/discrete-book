For how many three digit numbers (100 to 999) is the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sum of the digits</em> even? (For example, \(343\) has an even sum of digits: \(3+4+3 = 10\) which is even.) Find the answer and explain why it is correct in at least two <!--Style me with CSS--><em>different</em> ways.

There are multiple ways to do this.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-576">An even sum can occur in 4 ways: EEE, EOO, OEO, and OOE.  There are \(4 \cdot 5 \cdot 5\) ways to build numbers of the first two types (there are only 4 choices for a starting even number - it cannot be 0) and \(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5\) ways to build the second two types.  This gives a total of 450 numbers.</li>
<li id="li-577">To build a 3 digit number with an even sum, you can choose any of 9 digits for the first digit, any of 10 digits for the second digit.  Then the last digit must either be even (if the sum of the first two digits are even) or odd (if the sum of the first two digits are odd).  Luckily there are the same number of even last digits and odd last digits - 5.  So there are a total of \(9 \cdot 10 \cdot 5 = 450\) numbers with an even sum of digits.</li>
<li id="li-578">Start finding sums of digits from 3-digit numbers: \(100 \to\) odd, \(101 \to\) even, \(102 \to\)odd, \(103 \to\) even, and so on.  So the numbers appear to alternate between even and odd sums.  However, notice that 109 has an even sum while 110 does as well.  But then 111 is odd, 112 is even, and so on.  So we can conclude that half of the numbers 100 to 109 have even sum, half of the number 110 to 119 have even sum, half from 120 to 129, and so on.  This means that overall half of the numbers will have even sum, so half of the 900 3-digit numbers will have even sum, namely 450 of them.</li>
