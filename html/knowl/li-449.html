</h5>There are four possibilities when it comes to order and repeats.  If order matters and repeats are allowed, the answer will look like \(n^k\).  If order matters and repeats are not allowed, we have \(P(n,k)\).  If order doesn't matter and repeats are allowed, use stars and bars.  If order doesn't matter and repeats are not allowed, use \({n\choose k}\).  But be careful: this only applies when you are selecting things, and you should make sure you know exactly what you are selecting before determining which case you are in.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_count-conc.html#li-449">in-context</a></span>
