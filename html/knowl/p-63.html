Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as to what “everything” is. Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers. In this case we would say that our <!--Style me with CSS--><em>universe</em> is \(\N\). Sometimes we denote this universe by \(\U\). Given this context, we might wish to speak of all the elements which are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> in a particular set. We say \(B\) is the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>complement</em> of \(A\), and write,
\begin{equation*}
  B = \bar A
\end{equation*}
when \(B\) contains every element not contained in \(A\). So if our universe is \(\{1, 2,\ldots, 9, 10\}\), and \(A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}\), then \(\bar A = \{1, 4, 6, 8, 9,10\}\).
