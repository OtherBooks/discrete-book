We get 6 toppings (counting possible repeats). Represent each of these toppings as a star. Think of going down the menu one topping at a time: you see anchovies first, and skip to the next, sausage. You say yes to sausage 3 times (use 3 stars), then switch to the next topping on the list. You keep skipping until you get to pineapple, which you say yes to twice. Another switch and you are at onions. You say yes once. Then you keep switching until you get to the last topping, never saying yes again (since you already have said yes 6 times. There are 10 toppings to choose from, so we must switch from considering one topping to the next 9 times. These are the bars.
