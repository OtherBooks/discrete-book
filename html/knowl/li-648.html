</h5>6, 10, 15, 21, 28, â€¦. These are all triangular numbers.  However, we are starting with 6 as our first term instead of as our third term.  So if we could plug in 3 instead of 1 into the formula for \(T_n\), we would be set.  Therefore the closed formula is \(\frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}\) (where \(n+3\) came from \((n+2)+1\))</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_seq_basics.html#li-648">in-context</a></span>
