Another caution: how many ways can you select two cards, so that the first one is a red card and the second one is a face card? This looks more like the multiplicative principle (you are counting two separate events) but the answer is not \(26 \cdot 12\) here either. The problem is that while there are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the case that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>for each</em> of those there are 12 ways to select the second card. If the first card was both red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second card. The moral of this story is that the multiplicative principle only works if the events are independent.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-1" id="fn-1"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-1" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">To solve this problem, you could break it into two cases. First, count how many ways there are to select the two cards when the first card is a red non-face card. Second, count how many ways when the first card is a red face card.  Doing so makes the events in each separate case independent, so the multiplicative principle can be applied.</span></span>
