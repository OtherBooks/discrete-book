The answer to each of the counting questions is \({10 \choose 2}\), using 8 stars and 2 bars. The bars separate the kids, the variables, and the colors. To see why these are really the same, notice that we can think of the 3 kids as named \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Or think of \(x\) as red, \(y\) as blue and \(z\) as yellow. Notice that in each case, the three things are distinguishable, while the 8 things (cookies, units, crayons) are all identical.
