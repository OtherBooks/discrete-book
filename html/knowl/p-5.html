While I (currently) believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free to skip around to what interests you. There are occasionally examples and exercises that rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum and usually can either be skipped or understood without too much additional study. If you are an instructor, feel free to edit the <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>Â source to fit your needs.
