Let \(y\) be an element of the codomain \(\Z\). We will show there is an element \(n\) of the domain (\(\Z\)) such that \(f(n) = y\). There are two cases. First, if \(y\) is even, then let \(n = y+3\). Since \(y\) is even, \(n\) is odd, so \(f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y\) as desired. Second, if \(y\) is odd, then let \(n = y-1\). Since \(y\) is odd, \(n\) is even, so \(f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y\) as needed. Therefore \(f\) is surjective.
