The advanced use of PIE has applications beyond stars and bars. A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>derangement</em> of \(n\) elements \(\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}\) is a permutation in which no element is fixed. For example, there are \(6\) permutations of the three elements \(\{1,2,3\}\):
\begin{equation*}
  123 ~~ 132 ~~ 213 ~~ 231 ~~ 312 ~~ 321.
\end{equation*}
but most of these have one or more elements fixed: \(123\) has all three elements fixed, \(132\) has the first element fixed (1 is in its original first position), and so on. In fact, the only derangements of three elements are
\begin{equation*}
  231 \mbox{  and  } 312.
\end{equation*}
