We would like to state these observations in a more precise way, and then prove that they are correct. Now each entry in Pascal's triangle is in fact a binomial coefficient. The 1 on the very top of the triangle is \({0 \choose 0}\). The next row (which we will call row 1, even though it is not the top-most row) consists of \({1 \choose 0}\) and \({1 \choose 1}\). Row 4 (the row 1, 4, 6, 4, 1) consists of the binomial coefficients
\begin{equation*}
  {4 \choose 0} ~~ {4 \choose 1} ~~ {4 \choose 2} ~~ {4 \choose 3} ~~ {4 \choose 4}.
\end{equation*}
