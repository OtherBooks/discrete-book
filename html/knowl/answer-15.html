No. There must be 5 elements in common to both sets. Since there are 10 distinct elements all together in \(A\) and \(B\), this means that between \(A\) and \(B\), there must be 5 elements which they do not have in common (some in \(A\) but not in \(B\), some in \(B\) but not in \(A\)). But 5 is odd, so to have \(|A| = |B|\), we would need 7.5 elements in each set, which is impossible.
