The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for all of his friends. As a way to kick things off, they decide that everyone should shake hands. Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands with every other person (but not themselves, obviously) exactly once, how many handshakes take place?

At the warm-up event for Oscar's All Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al ate one hot dog. Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs. Not to be outdone, Carl ate five. This continued with each contestant eating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant. How many hot dogs did Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat? How many hot dogs were eaten all together?

While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls. Each is either a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>knight</em>, who always tells the truth, or a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>knave</em>, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-1">Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.</li>
<li id="li-2">Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.</li>
<li id="li-3">Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.</li>
</ul>
<p id="p-26">
Which troll is which?

Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to build roads directly connecting each pair of towns. While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they wished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each other (as stop signs had not yet been invented). Also, tunnels and bridges were not allowed. Is it possible for each of these towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without creating any intersections?
