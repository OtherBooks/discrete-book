A function is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. The set of all inputs for a function is called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>domain</em>. The set of all allowable outputs is called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>codomain</em>. For example, a function might assign each natural number to a natural number from 1 to 5. In that case, the domain is the natural numbers and the codomain is the set of natural numbers from 1 to 5. Now it could be that this particular function we are thinking about assigns each even natural number to the number 2 and each odd natural number to the number 1. In this case, not all of the codomain is actually used. We would say that the set \(\{1,2\}\) is the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>range</em> of the function. These are the elements in the codomain (allowable outputs) which are actually outputs for some input.
