But wait â€“ 32 and 10 were the answers to the counting questions about subsets. Coincidence? Not at all. Each bit string can be thought of as a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>code</em> for a subset. For the set \(A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}\), we would use 5-bit strings, one bit for each element of \(A\). Each bit in the string is a 0 if its corresponding element of \(A\) is not in the subset, and a 1 if the element of \(A\) is in the subset. Remember, deciding the subset amounted to a sequence of five yes/no votes for the elements of \(A\). Instead of yes, we put a 1; instead of no, we put a 0.
