But is this correct? It is if we assume that the 8 games are distinct, or more importantly, that it matters which game goes to which friend. As it turns out, the 8 games you have are all copies of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> (it is a great game after all). Now it really doesn't make sense to think of this as a function, since the domain is not a set of 8 objects. Instead we recognize this as a stars and bars problem, and deduce the answer of \({12 \choose 8}\).
