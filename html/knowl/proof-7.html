Question: How many subsets of size \(k\) are there of the set \(\{1,2,\ldots, n\}\)?
</p>
<p>
Answer 1: You must choose \(k\) out of \(n\) elements to put in the set, which can be done in \({n \choose k}\) ways.
</p>
<p>
Answer 2: First count the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \(\{1,2,\ldots, n\}\) which contain the number \(n\). We must choose \(k-1\) of the \(n-1\) other element to include in this set. Thus there are \({n-1\choose k-1}\) such subsets. We have not yet counted all the \(k\)-element subsets of \(\{1,2,\ldots, n\}\) though. In fact, we have missed exactly those subsets which do NOT contain \(n\). To form one of these subsets, we need to choose \(k\) of the other \(n-1\) elements, so this can be done in \({n-1 \choose k}\) ways. Thus the answer to the question is \({n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}\).
