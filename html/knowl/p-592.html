Perhaps a more descriptive way to write this is
\begin{equation*}
  {3 \choose 1}2^5 - {3 \choose 2}1^5 + {3 \choose 3}0^5.
\end{equation*}
since each of the \(2^5\)'s was the result of choosing 1 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude from the range, each of the three \(1^5\)'s was the result of choosing 2 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude. Writing \(1^5\) instead of 1 makes sense too: we have 1 choice of were to send each of the 5 elements of the domain.
