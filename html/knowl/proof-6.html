Consider the question: How many lattice paths are there from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\)?
</p>
<p>
Answer 1: We must travel \(2n\) units, and \(n\) of them must be in the up direction. Thus there are \({2n \choose n}\) paths.
</p>
<p>
Answer 2: Note that any path from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) must cross the line \(x + y = n\). That is, any path must pass through exactly one of the points: \((0,n)\), \((1,n-1)\), \((2,n-2)\), â€¦, \((n, 0)\). For example, this is what happens in the case \(n = 4\):

How many paths pass through \((0,n)\)? To get to that point, you must travel \(n\) units, and \(0\) of them are to the right, so there are \({n \choose 0}\) ways to get to \((0,n)\). From \((0,n)\) to \((n,n)\) takes \(n\) steps, and \(0\) of them are up. So there are \({n \choose 0}\) ways to get from \((0,n)\) to \((n,n)\). Therefore there are \({n \choose 0}{n \choose 0}\) paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) through the point \((0,n)\).
</p>
<p>
What about through \((1,n-1)\). There are \({n \choose 1}\) paths to get there (\(n\) steps, 1 to the right) and \({n \choose 1}\) paths to complete the journey to \((n,n)\) (\(n\) steps, \(1\) up). So there are \({n \choose 1}{n \choose 1}\) paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) through \((1,n-1)\).
</p>
<p>
In general, to get to \((n,n)\) through the point \((k,n-k)\) we have \({n \choose k}\) paths to the midpoint and then \({n \choose k}\) paths from the midpoint to \((n,n)\). So there are \({n \choose k}{n \choose k}\) paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) through \((k, n-k)\).
</p>
<p>
All together then the total paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) passing through exactly one of these midpoints is
\begin{equation*}
  {n \choose 0}^2 + {n \choose 1}^2 + {n \choose 2}^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n}^2.
\end{equation*}
