Question: How many ways can you select a chaired committee of \(k\) people from a group of \(n\) people? That is, you need to select \(k\) people to be on the committee and one of them needs to be in charge. How many ways can this happen?
</p>
<p id="p-717">
Answer 1: First select \(k\) of the \(n\) people to be on the committee. This can be done in \({n \choose k}\) ways. Now select one of those \(k\) people to be in charge - this can be done in \(k\) ways. So there are a total of \(k {n \choose k}\) ways to select the chaired committee.
</p>

Answer 2: First select the chair of the committee. You have \(n\) people to choose from, so this can be done in \(n\) ways. Now fill the rest of the committee. There are \(n-1\) people to choose from (you cannot select the person you picked to be the chair) and \(k-1\) spots to fill (the chair's spot is already taken). So this can be done in \({n-1 \choose k-1}\) ways. Therefore there are \(n{n-1 \choose k-1}\) ways to select the chaired committee.
