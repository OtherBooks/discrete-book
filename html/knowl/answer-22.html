<li id="li-149">\(f\) is not injective.  To prove this, we must simply find two different elements of the domain which map to the same element of the codomain.  Since \(f(\{1\}) = 1\) and \(f(\{2\}) = 1\), we see that \(f\) is not injective.</li>
<li id="li-150">\(f\) is not surjective.  The largest subset of \(A\) is \(A\) itself, and \(|A| = 10\).  So no natural number greater than 10 will ever be an output.</li>
<li id="li-151">\(f\inv(1) = \{\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \ldots \{10\}\}\) (the set of all the singleton subsets of \(A\)).</li>
<li id="li-152">\(f\inv(0) = \{\emptyset\}\).  Note, it would be wrong to write \(f\inv(0) = \emptyset\) - that would claim that there is no input which has 0 as an output.</li>
<li id="li-153">\(f\inv(12) = \emptyset\), since there are no subsets of \(A\) with cardinality 12.</li>
