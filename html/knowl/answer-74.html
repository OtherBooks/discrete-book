<li id="li-366">You take 3 strawberry, 1 lime, 0 licorice, 2 blueberry and 0 bubblegum.</li>
<li id="li-367">This is backwards.  We don't want the stars to represent the kids because the kids are not identical, but the stars are.  Instead we should use 5 stars (for the lollipops) and use 5 bars to switch between the 6 kids.  For example, **||***||| would represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops, the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.</li>
<li id="li-368">This is the word AAAEOO.</li>
<li id="li-369">This doesn't represent a solution.  Each star should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the bars should <!--Style me with CSS--><em>switch</em> between the different variables.  We have one too many bars.</li>
