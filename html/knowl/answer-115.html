Of your \(n\) bow ties, you decide to give \(k\) away to charity. How many ways can you do this? On one hand, you can choose \(k\) of the \(n\) bow ties to give away in \({n \choose k}\) ways. Alternatively, you can choose which bow ties to keep. You must keep \(n -k\) of them if you will give \(k\) away, so you can choose the bow ties to keep in \({n \choose n-k}\) ways. This gives a combinatorial proof for the identity.
