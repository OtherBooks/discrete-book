The Stanley Cup is decided in a best of 7 tournament between two teams. In how many ways can your team win? Let's answer this question two ways:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-294">How many of the 7 games does your team need to win?  How many ways can this happen?</li>
<li id="li-295">What if the tournament goes all 7 games?  So you win the last game.  How many ways can the first 6 games go down?</li>
<li id="li-296">What if the tournament goes just 6 games?  How many ways can this happen?  What about 5 games?  4 games?</li>
<li id="li-297">What are the two different ways to compute the number of ways your team can win?  Write down an equation involving binary coefficients (that is, \({n \choose k}\)'s).  What pattern in Pascal's triangle is this an example of?</li>
