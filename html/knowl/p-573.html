Let's shift focus and think about counting in another way. Consider again the problem of giving cookies to kids. One way to think about this problem is to say that we are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>assigning</em> each cookie to a kid. So far the cookies have been identical, so it did not matter which cookie went to which kid. But what if it did? Suppose we have 7 different cookies and 4 different kids. How many ways are there to give out the cookies?
