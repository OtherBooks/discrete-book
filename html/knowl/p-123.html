To be a function, a map cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen that the reverse is permissible. That is, a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When this <!--Style me with CSS--><em>does not</em> occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is assigned to at most one element of the domain) then we say the function is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>one-to-one</em>}one-to-one|see {injection}. Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain. One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>injection</em>. We call one-to-one functions <!--Style me with CSS--><em>injective</em> functions.
