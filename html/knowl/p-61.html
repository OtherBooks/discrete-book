Is it possible to add two sets? Not really, however there is something similar. If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set, then we can take the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>union</em> of the two sets. Symbolically,
\begin{equation*}
  C = A \gls{cup} B,
\end{equation*}
read, “\(C\) is the union of \(A\) and \(B\),” means that the elements of \(C\) are exactly the elements which are either an element of \(A\) or an element of \(B\) (or an element of both). For example, if \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), then \(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
