 While we are thinking about sets, consider what happens to the additive principle when the sets are NOT disjoint. Suppose we want to find \(|A \cup B|\) and know that \(|A| = 10\) and \(|B| = 8\). This is not enough information though. We do not know how many of the 8 elements in \(B\) are also elements of \(A\). However, if we also know that \(|A \cap B| = 6\), then we can say exactly how many elements are in \(A\), and, of those, how many are in \(B\) and how many are not (6 of the 10 elements are in \(B\), so 4 are in \(A\) but not in \(B\)). We could fill in a Venn diagram  as follows:
