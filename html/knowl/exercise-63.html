Suppose you are ordering a large pizza from <!--Style me with CSS--><em>D.P.Â Dough</em>. You want 3 distinct toppings, chosen from their list of 11 vegetarian toppings.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-254">How many choices do you have for your pizza?</li>
<li id="li-255">How many choices do you have for your pizza if you refuse to have pineapple as one of your toppings?</li>
<li id="li-256">How many choices do you have for your pizza if you <!--Style me with CSS--><em>insist</em> on having pineapple as one of your toppings?</li>
<li id="li-257">How do the three questions above relate to each other?</li>
</ol></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper">
<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-answer-51" id="answer-51"><span class="heading"><span class="type">Answer</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-answer-51" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-258">\({11 \choose 3} = 165\), since you have to select a 3-element subset of the set of 11 toppings.</li>
<li id="li-259">\({10 \choose 3} = 120\), since you must select 3 of the 10 non-pineapple toppings.</li>
<li id="li-260">\({10 \choose 2} = 45\), since you must select 2 of the remaining 10 non-pineapple toppings to have in addition to the pineapple.</li>
<li id="li-261">\(165  = 120 + 45\), which makes sense because every 3-topping pizza either has pineapple or does not have pineapple as a topping.</li>
