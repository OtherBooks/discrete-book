Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way. We could have started with all of \(C\), then excluded the region where \(C\) and \(A\) overlap outside of \(B\). That region is \((A \cap C) \cap \bar B\). So the above Venn diagram also represents \(C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}.\) So using just the picture, we have determined that
\begin{equation*}
  (B \cap C) \cup (C \cap \bar A) = C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}.
\end{equation*}
