<li id="li-489">Neither.  \({14 \choose 4}\).</li>
<li id="li-490">\({10\choose 4}\).</li>
<li id="li-491">\(P(10,4)\), since order is important.</li>
<li id="li-492">Neither. Assuming you will wear each of the 4 ties on just 4 of the 7 days, without repeats: \({10\choose 4}P(7,4)\).</li>
<li id="li-493">\(P(10,4)\).</li>
<li id="li-494">\({10\choose 4}\).</li>
<li id="li-495">Neither. Since you could repeat letters: \(10^4\). If no repeats are allowed, it would be \(P(10,4)\).</li>
<li id="li-496">Neither.  Actually, “k” is the 11th letter of the alphabet, so the answer is 0.  If “k” was among the first 10 letters, there would only be 1 way - write it down.</li>
<li id="li-497">Neither.  Either \({9\choose 3}\) (if every kid gets an apple) or \({13 \choose 3}\) (if appleless kids are allowed).</li>
<li id="li-498">Neither.  Note that this could not be \({10 \choose 4}\) since the 10 things and 4 things are from different groups.  \(4^{10}\).</li>
<li id="li-499">\({10 \choose 4}\) - don't be fooled by the “arrange” in there - you are picking 4 out of 10 <!--Style me with CSS--><em>spots</em> to put the 1's.</li>
<li id="li-500">\({10 \choose 4}\) (assuming order is irrelevant).</li>
<li id="li-501">Neither.  \(16^{10}\) (each kid chooses yes or no to 4 varieties).</li>
<li id="li-502">Neither.  0.</li>
<li id="li-503">Neither.  \(4^{10} - [{4\choose 1}3^{10} - {4\choose 2}2^{10} + {4 \choose 3}1^{10}]\).</li>
<li id="li-504">Neither.  \(10\cdot 4\).</li>
<li id="li-505">Neither. \(4^{10}\).</li>
<li id="li-506">\({10 \choose 4}\) (which is the same as \({10 \choose 6}\)).</li>
<li id="li-507">Neither.  If all the kids were identical, and you wanted no empty teams, it would be \({10 \choose 4}\).  Instead, this will be the same as the number of surjective functions from a set of size 11 to a set of size 5.</li>
<li id="li-508">\({10 \choose 4}\).</li>
<li id="li-509">\({10 \choose 4}\).</li>
<li id="li-510">Neither.  \(4!\).</li>
<li id="li-511">Neither.  It's \({10 \choose 4}\) if you won't repeat any choices.  If repetition is allowed, then this becomes \(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots +x_{10} = 4\), which has \({13 \choose 9}\) solutions in non-negative integers.</li>
<li id="li-512">Neither.  Since repetition of cookie type is allowed, the answer is \(10^4\).  Without repetition, you would have \(P(10,4)\).</li>
<li id="li-513">\({10 \choose 4}\) since that is equal to \({9 \choose 4} + {9 \choose 3}\).</li>
<li id="li-514">Neither.  It will be a complicated (possibly PIE) counting problem.</li>
