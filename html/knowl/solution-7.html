\(f\) is a function. So is \(g\). There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the output for any input, and there is no problem with \(a\) from the codomain being the output of both 2 and 3 from the domain.
</p>
<p>
However, \(h\) is not a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (\(a\) and \(c\)). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. for example, neither of the following mappings are functions:
