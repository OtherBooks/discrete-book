First we should check that these sequences really are arithmetic. Doing so will reveal the common difference \(d\).
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-672">\(5-2 = 3\), \(8-5 = 3\), etc.  To get from each term to the next, we add three, so \(d = 3\).  The recursive definition is therefore \(a_n = a_{n-1} + 3\) with \(a_0 = 2\).  The closed formula is \(a_n = 2 + 3n\).</li>
<li id="li-673">Here the common difference is \(-7\), since we add \(-7\) to 50 to get 43, and so on.  Thus we have a recursive definition of \(a_n = a_{n-1} - 7\) with \(a_0 = 50\).  The closed formula is \(a_n = 50 - 7n\).</li>
</ol>
