When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say \(x\)) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write \(f(x)\)). It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say \(y\)) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain get sent to it. We could write “those \(x\) in the domain such that \(f(x) = y\),” but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.
