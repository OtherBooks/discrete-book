</h5>Now suppose you want to stop and get a donut on the way to work, from your favorite donut shoppe on the corner of 8th st and 10th ave.  How many routes to work, via the donut shoppe, can you take (again, ensuring the shortest possible route)?

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-60" id="solution-60"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-60" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like">
<p id="p-697">
The donut shoppe is 16 blocks away, 7 one way, 9 the other. So to get from home to the donut shoppe, there are \({16 \choose 7}\) routes (or equivalently, \({16 \choose 9}\)). Then from the donut shopped to work, you need to travel 6 more blocks, 2 on way and 4 the other. So there are \({6 \choose 2}\) (or \({6 \choose 4}\)) routes from the donut shoppe to work.
</p>
<p id="p-698">
For each of the ways to the donut shoppe, there are so many ways to work, so the multiplicative principle says the total number of ways from home to work via the donut shoppe is
\begin{equation*}
  {16 \choose 7}{6 \choose 2}
\end{equation*}
