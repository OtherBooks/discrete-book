What about the sets \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)? Clearly \(A \ne B\), but notice that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). Because of this we say that \(A\) is a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>subset</em> of \(B\), or in symbols \(A \subset B\) or \(A \subseteq B\). (Both symbols are read “is a subset of.” The difference is that sometimes we want to say that \(A\) is either equal to or a subset of \(B\), in which case we use \(\subseteq\). This is analoguous to the difference between \(\lt\) and \(\le\).)
