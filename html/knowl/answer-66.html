<li id="li-317">She has \({15 \choose 6}\) ways to select the 6 bridesmaids, and then for each way, has 6 choices for the maid of honor.  Thus she has \({15 \choose 6}6\) choices.</li>
<li id="li-318">She has 15 choices for who will be her maid of honor.  Then she needs to select 5 of the remaining 14 friends to be bridesmaids, which she can do in \({14 \choose 5}\) ways.  Thus she has \(15 {14 \choose 5}\) choices.</li>
<li id="li-319">We have answered the question (how many wedding parties can the bride choose from) in two ways.  The first way gives the left hand side of the identity and the second way gives the right hand side of the identity.  Therefore the identity holds.</li>
