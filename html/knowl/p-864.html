Before we get too carried away, let's consider an example: How many squares (of all sizes) are there on a chessboard? A chessboard consists of \(64\) squares, but we also want to consider squares of longer side length. Even though we are only considering an \(8 \times 8\) board, there is already a lot to count. So instead, let us build a sequence: the first term will be the number of squares on a \(1 \times 1\) board, the second term will be the number of squares on a \(2 \times 2\) board, and so on. After a little thought, we arrive at the sequence
\begin{equation*}
  1,5,14,30, 55,\ldots
\end{equation*}
