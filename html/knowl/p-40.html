Defining a set using this sort of notation is very useful, although it takes some practice to read them correctly. It is a way to describe the set of all things that satisfy some condition (the condition is the logical statement after the “:” symbol). Here are some more examples. We use the symbols \(\wedge\) for “and” and \(\vee\) for “or” (which includes the “or both” for us).
