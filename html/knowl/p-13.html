This book would not exist if not for “Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics” by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus. It is the book I learned discrete math out of, and taught out of the semester before I began writing this text. I wanted to maintain the inquiry based feel of their book but update, expand and rearrange some of the material. In many ways I see this current text as a “reboot” of their book.
