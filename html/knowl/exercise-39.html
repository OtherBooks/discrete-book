In the game of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Hearts</em>, four players are each dealt 13 cards from a deck of 52. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?

Yes, as long as the set of cards is the domain and the set of players is the codomain. The function is not injective because multiple cards go to each player. It is surjective since all players get cards.
