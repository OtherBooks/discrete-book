For us, a set will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played <!--Style me with CSS--><em>The Doctor</em> on <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Doctor Who</em>, or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is a element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also, the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements.
