\({14 \choose 5}\). This is in fact a stars and bars problem. The stars are the 5 inputs and the bars are the 9 spots between the 10 possible outputs. Think of it this way - we will specify \(f(1)\), then \(f(2)\), then \(f(3)\), and so on in that order. Start with the possible output 0. We can use it as the output of \(f(1)\), or we can switch to 1 as a potential output. Say we put \(f(1) = 1\). Now we are at 1 (can't go back to 0). Should \(f(2) = 1\)? If yes, then we are putting down another star. If no, put down a bar and switch to 2. Maybe you switch to 3, then assign \(f(2) = 3\) and \(f(3) = 3\) (two more stars) before switching to 4 as a possible output. And so on.
