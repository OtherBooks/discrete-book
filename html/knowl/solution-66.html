<p>
\(P(n,k)\) counts the number of stacks of size \(k\) where the chips come in \(n\) different colors (with at most one chip of each color in the stack). You could count this by first forming all stacks of \(n\) chips, and there are \(n!\) of these. But to get stacks of size \(k\), we don't want the top \(n-k\) chips. When we remove \(n-k\) chips from the stacks, we sometimes get the same arrangement of the bottom chips. In fact, for each arrangement of the bottom \(k\) chips, there are \((n-k)!\) different ways to arrange the top \(n-k\) chips, and all of these should count as just 1 outcome. Thus we divide \(n!\) by \((n-k)!\) to find the number of \(k\)-chip stacks.
