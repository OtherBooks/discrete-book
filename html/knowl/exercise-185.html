Consider the sequence \(2, 7, 15, 26, 40, 57, \ldots\) (with \(a_0 = 2\)). By looking at the differences between terms, express the sequence as a sequence of partial sums. Then find a closed formula for the sequence by computing the \(n\)th partial sum.

We have \(2 = 2\), \(7 = 2+5\), \(15 = 2 + 5 + 8\), \(26 = 2+5+8+11\), and so on. The terms in the sums are given by the arithmetic sequence \(b_n = 2+3n\). In other words, \(a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n 2+3k\). To find this, we reverse and add. We get \(a_n = \frac{(4+3n)(n+1)}{2}\) (we have \(n+1\) there because there are \(n+1\) terms in the sum for \(a_n\)).
