<p id="p-694">
Gridtown USA, besides having excellent donut shoppes, is known for its precisely laid out grid of streets and avenues. Streets run east-west, and avenues north-south, for the entire stretch of the town, never curving and never interrupted by parks or schools or the like.
</p>
<p id="p-695">
Suppose you live on the corner of 1st and 1st and work on the corner of 12th and 12th. Thus you must travel 22 blocks to get to work as quickly as possible.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-589">How many different routes can you take to work, assuming you want to get there as quickly as possible?

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-59" id="solution-59"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-59" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like"><p id="p-696">
\({22 \choose 11}\) since you must choose 11 of the 22 blocks to travel east.
</p></div></span>
</li>
<li id="li-590">Now suppose you want to stop and get a donut on the way to work, from your favorite donut shoppe on the corner of 8th st and 10th ave.  How many routes to work, via the donut shoppe, can you take (again, ensuring the shortest possible route)?

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-60" id="solution-60"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-60" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like">
<p id="p-697">
The donut shoppe is 16 blocks away, 7 one way, 9 the other. So to get from home to the donut shoppe, there are \({16 \choose 7}\) routes (or equivalently, \({16 \choose 9}\)). Then from the donut shopped to work, you need to travel 6 more blocks, 2 on way and 4 the other. So there are \({6 \choose 2}\) (or \({6 \choose 4}\)) routes from the donut shoppe to work.
</p>
<p id="p-698">
For each of the ways to the donut shoppe, there are so many ways to work, so the multiplicative principle says the total number of ways from home to work via the donut shoppe is
\begin{equation*}
  {16 \choose 7}{6 \choose 2}
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div></span>
</li>
<li id="li-591">Disaster Strikes Gridtown: there is a pothole on 4th avenue between 5th and 6th street.  How many routes to work can you take avoiding that unsightly (and dangerous) stretch of road?

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-61" id="solution-61"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-61" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like">
<p id="p-699">
Routes to work that hit the pothole: \({7 \choose 3}1{14 \choose 8}\).
</p>
<p id="p-700">
There for the number of routes to work which <!--Style me with CSS--><em>avoid</em> the pothole are
\begin{equation*}
  {22 \choose 11} - {7 \choose 3}{14 \choose 8}
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div></span>
</li>
<li id="li-592">How many routes are there both avoiding the pothole and visiting the donut shoppe?

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-62" id="solution-62"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-62" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like">
<p id="p-701">
First compute the number of routes to the donut shoppe avoiding the pothole:
\begin{equation*}
  {16 \choose 7} - {7 \choose 3}{8 \choose 6}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p id="p-702">
Then you still need to go to work from there. Thus the answer is:
\begin{equation*}
  \left({16 \choose 7} - {7 \choose 3}{8 \choose 6}\right){6 \choose 2}
\end{equation*}
