Again, we have a sum of an arithmetic sequence. We need to know how many terms are in the sequence. Clearly each term in the sequence has the form \(4k -2\) (as evidenced by the last term). For which values of \(k\) though? To get 6, \(k = 2\). To get \(4n-2\) take \(k = n\). So to find the number of terms, we need to know how many integers are in the range \(2,3,\ldots, n\). The answer is \(n-1\). (There are \(n\) numbers from 1 to \(n\), so one less if we start with 2.)
