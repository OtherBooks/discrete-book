<li id="li-8">This is the set of all number which are 3 less than a natural number (i.e., that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number).  The set could also be written as \(\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\) (note that 0 is a natural number, so \(-3\) is in this set because \(-3 + 3 = 0\)).</li>
<li id="li-9">This is the set of all natural numbers which are 3 less than a natural number.  So here we just have \(\{0, 1, 2,3 \ldots\}\).</li>
<li id="li-10">This is the set of all integers (positive and negative whole numbers, written \(\Z\)).  In other words, \(\{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\).</li>
<li id="li-11">Here we want all numbers \(x\) such that \(x\) and \(-x\) are natural numbers.  There is only one: 0.  So we have the set \(\{0\}\).</li>
