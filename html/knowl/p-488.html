Why have we done all of this? Simple: to count the number of ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids, all we need to do is count how many <!--Style me with CSS--><em>stars and bars</em> charts there are. But a stars and bars chart is just a string of symbols, some stars and some bars. If instead of stars and bars we would use 0's and 1's, it would just be a bit string. We know how to count those.
