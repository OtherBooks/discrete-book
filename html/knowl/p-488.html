Does that correspond to a cookie distribution? Yes. It represents the distribution in which kid A gets 0 cookies (because we switch to kid B before any stars), kid B gets three cookies (three stars before the next bar), kid C gets 0 cookies (no stars before the next bar) and kid D gets the remaining 4 cookies. No matter how the stars and bars are arranged, we can distribute cookies in that way. Also, given any way to distribute cookies, we can represent that with a stars and bars chart. For example, the distribution in which kid A gets 6 cookies and kid B gets 1 cookie has the following chart:
