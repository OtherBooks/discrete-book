One reason it is difficult to define discrete math is that it is a very broad description which encapsulates a large number of subjects. In this course we will study four main topics: <!--Style me with CSS--><em>combinatorics</em> (the theory of ways things <!--Style me with CSS--><em>combine</em>; in particular, how to count these ways), <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sequences</em>, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>logic</em>, and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>graph theory</em>. However, there are other topics that belong under the discrete umbrella, including computer science, abstract algebra, number theory, game theory, probability, and geometry (some of these, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete variants).
