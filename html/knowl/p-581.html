So what about surjective functions? In the previous example, there are exactly \(5! = 120\) surjections. We know this because whenever the domain and codomain of a function are the same finite size, a function is injective if and only if it is surjective. In general, if the domain and codomain both contain \(n\) elements, then the number of surjective functions is \(n!\), since this is the number of injective functions. Also, if the codomain is strictly larger than the domain, then the surjective functions are easy to count: there are 0 of them (since there will always be elements of the codomain left out of the range). But what if the size of the codomain is smaller than the size of the domain?
