If you consider the factorization of any divisor of 735000 it must have at most three 2s, at most one 3, at most four 5s and at most two 7s, with no other prime factors. Thus to select a divisor, we just need to pick how many of these prime factors are present. There are 4 choices for how many 2s to include (between zero and four), 2 choices for how many 3s, 5 choices for how many 5s and 3 choices for how many 7s. Thus the number of divisors is:
\begin{equation*}
  4\cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 120
\end{equation*}
