Your friend tells you she has 7 coins in her hand (just pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters). If you guess how many of each kind of coin she has, she will give them to you. If you guess randomly, what is the probability that you will be correct?

We must figure out how many different combinations of 7 coins are possible. Let a star represent each coin, and a bar represent switching between type of coin. So for example **|*||**** represents 2 pennies, one nickel, no dimes and 4 quarters. The number of such star and bar diagrams (with 7 stars and 3 bars) is \({10 \choose 3} = 120\). Thus you have a 1 in 120 chance of guessing correctly.
