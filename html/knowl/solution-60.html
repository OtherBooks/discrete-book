<p>
The donut shoppe is 16 blocks away, 7 one way, 9 the other. So to get from home to the donut shoppe, there are \({16 \choose 7}\) routes (or equivalently, \({16 \choose 9}\)). Then from the donut shopped to work, you need to travel 6 more blocks, 2 on way and 4 the other. So there are \({6 \choose 2}\) (or \({6 \choose 4}\)) routes from the donut shoppe to work.
</p>
<p>
For each of the ways to the donut shoppe, there are so many ways to work, so the multiplicative principle says the total number of ways from home to work via the donut shoppe is
\begin{equation*}
  {16 \choose 7}{6 \choose 2}
\end{equation*}
