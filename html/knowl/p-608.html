What if we did try to use a function to describe the situation? What should the domain be? It cannot be the 5 friends, because a single element of the domain cannot be mapped to more than one element of the codomain (and we must give away all the games). So the domain is the set of 8 games and the codomain is the set of 5 friends. In this interpretation, assuming that we don't need to give at least one game to each friend, we are just looking for functions, not necessarily injective functions. So the answer would be \(5^8\).
