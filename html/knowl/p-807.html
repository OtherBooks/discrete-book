In the examples and formulas above, we assumed that the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>initial</em> term was \(a_0\). If your sequence starts with \(a_1\), you can easily find the term that would have been \(a_0\) and use that in the formula. For example, if we want a formula for the sequence \(2, 5, 8,\ldots\) and insist that \(2= a_1\), then we can find \(a_0 = -1\) (since the sequence is arithmetic with common difference 3, we have \(a_0 + 3 = a_1\)). Then the closed formula will be \(a_n = -1 + 3n\).
