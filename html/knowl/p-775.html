Write out the first few terms of the sequence: \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\ldots\). This is surprising at first, but note that we could write \(2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} = a_{n-1} + (a_{n-1} -a_{n-2})\), and \(a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}\) is just the difference between the terms. Initially, the difference between terms is 1, so each time we are just adding one. So we see that \(a_n = n\) is the closed formula.
