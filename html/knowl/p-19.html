In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers (maybe the set of number in the range of a function). You would represent this set as an interval: \([0,\infty)\) is the range of \(f(x) = x^2\) since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater. This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and there are infinitely many more between them which are also in the set. Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would not be an interval. Consider the function which gives the number of children each person reading this has. What is the range? I'm guessing it is something like \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). Maybe 4 is in there too. But certainly there is nobody reading this that has 1.32419 children. This set <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> discrete because the elements are separate. Also notice that the inputs to the function are a discrete set as each input is an individual person. You would not consider fractional inputs (there is nothing we care about \(2/3\) between a pair of readers).
