To give a combinatorial proof we need to think up a question we can answer in two ways: one way needs to give the left-hand-side of the identity, the other way needs to be the right-hand-side of the identity. Our clue to what question to ask comes from the right hand side: \({n+2 \choose 3}\) counts the number of ways to select 3 things from a group of \(n+2\) things. Let's name those things \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n+2\). In other words, we want to find 3-element subsets of those numbers (since order should not matter, subsets are exactly the right thing to think about). We will have to be a bit clever to explain why the left-hand-side also gives the number of these subsets. Here's the proof.

Consider the question “How many 3-element subsets are there of the set \(\{1,2,3,\ldots, n+2\}\)?” We answer this in two ways:
</p>
<p id="p-408">
Answer 1: We must select 3 elements from the collection of \(n+2\) elements. This can be done in \({n+2 \choose 3}\) ways.
</p>
<p id="p-409">
Answer 2: Break this problem up into cases by what the middle number in the subset is. Say each subset is \(\{a,b,c\}\) written in increasing order. We count the number of subsets for each distinct value of \(b\). The smallest possible value of \(b\) is \(2\), and the largest is \(n+1\).
</p>
<p id="p-410">
When \(b = 2\), there are \(1 \cdot n\) subsets: 1 choice for \(a\) and \(n\) choices (3 through \(n+2\)) for \(c\).
</p>
<p id="p-411">
When \(b = 3\), there are \(2 \cdot (n-1)\) subsets: 2 choices for \(a\) and \(n-1\) choices for \(c\).
</p>
<p id="p-412">
When \(b = 4\), there are \(3 \cdot (n-2)\) subsets: 3 choices for \(a\) and \(n-2\) choices for \(c\).
</p>
<p id="p-413">
And so on. When \(b = n+1\), there are \(n\) choices for \(a\) and only 1 choice for \(c\), so \(n \cdot 1\) subsets.
</p>
<p id="p-414">
Therefore the total number of subsets is
\begin{equation*}
  1 n + 2 (n-1) + 3  (n-2) + \cdots + (n-1)2 + n  1.
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p id="p-415">
Since Answer 1 and Answer 2 are answers to the same question, they must be equal. Therefore
\begin{equation*}
  1 n + 2 (n-1) + 3  (n-2) + \cdots + (n-1) 2 + n  1 = {n+2 \choose 3}.
\end{equation*}
