Line up all \(x+y\) quirky clothing items - the \(x\) fezzes and \(y\) bow ties. Now pick 2 of them. This can be done in \({x+y \choose 2}\) ways. However, we might have picked 2 fezzes, which is not allowed. There are \({x \choose 2}\) ways to pick 2 fezzes. Similarly, the \({x+y \choose 2}\) ways to pick two items includes \({y \choose 2}\) ways to select 2 bow ties, also not allowed. Thus the total number of ways to pick a fez and a bow ties is
\begin{equation*}
  {x+y \choose 2} - {x \choose 2} - {y \choose 2}
\end{equation*}
