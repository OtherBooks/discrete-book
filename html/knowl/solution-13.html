First, how many two letter words start with A? We just need to select the second letter, which can be accomplished in 26 ways. So there are 26 words starting with A. There are also 26 words that start with B. To select a word which starts with either A or B, we can pick the word from the first 26 or the second 26, for a total of 52 words. The additive principle is at work here.

<p>
Now what about all the two letter words starting with a vowel? There are 26 starting with A, another 26 starting with E, and so on. We will have 5 groups of 26. So we add 26 to itself 5 times. Of course it would be easier to just multiply \(5\cdot 26\). We are really using the additive principle again, just using multiplication as a shortcut.
