We have seen that counting surjective functions is another nice example of the advanced use of the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion first introduced in \Cref{sec:advPIE}. Also, counting injective functions turns out to be equivalent to permutations, and counting all functions has a solution akin to those counting problems where order matters but repeats are allowed (like counting the number of words you can make from a given set of letters).
