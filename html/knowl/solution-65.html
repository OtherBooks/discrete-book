Say you made all \(12!\) stacks of 12 chips. For any particular arrangement of the bottom 5 chips, you will have \(7!\) stacks that have that bottom arrangement (one for each arrangement of the remaining 7 chips). But we just want to count the number of 5-chip stacks, so we count all of these as the same outcome (once the top 7 chips are removed, the bottom stacks look identical). Thus we really want to count how many groups there are. All \(12!\) stacks are grouped into groups of size \(7!\), so there are \(12!/7!\) groups.
