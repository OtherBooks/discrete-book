Recall that the formula for \(P(n,k)\) is \(\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}\). Your task here is to explain <!--Style me with CSS--><em>why</em> this is the right formula.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-593">Suppose you have 12 chips, each a different color.  How many different stacks of 5 chips can you make?  Explain your answer and why it is the same as using the formula for \(P(12,5)\).

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-63" id="solution-63"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-63" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like"><p id="p-704">
There are \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\cdot 9\cdot 8 = 95040\) different stacks of 5 chips. This is because there are 12 choices for which chip goes on bottom, then 11 choices for which comes next, and so on for a total of 5 chips. The formula for \(P(12,5)\) is \(\frac{12!}{7!}\) - the \(7!\) cancels out the part of \(12!\) we don't include.
</p></div></span>
</li>
<li id="li-594">Using the scenario of the 12 chips again, what does \(12!\) count?  What does \(7!\) count?  Explain.

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-64" id="solution-64"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-64" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like"><p id="p-705">
\(12!\) is the number of different stacks of all 12 chips (12 choices for the bottom chip, 11 for the next, and so on for 12 chips total). \(7!\) is the number of 7-chip stacks you can make using just 7 different colored chips (not all 12) because you have 7 choices for the first chip, 6 for the second, and so on.
</p></div></span>
</li>
<li id="li-595">Explain why it makes sense to divide \(12!\) by \(7!\) when computing \(P(12,5)\) (in terms of the chips).

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-65" id="solution-65"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-65" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like"><p id="p-706">
Say you made all \(12!\) stacks of 12 chips. For any particular arrangement of the bottom 5 chips, you will have \(7!\) stacks that have that bottom arrangement (one for each arrangement of the remaining 7 chips). But we just want to count the number of 5-chip stacks, so we count all of these as the same outcome (once the top 7 chips are removed, the bottom stacks look identical). Thus we really want to count how many groups there are. All \(12!\) stacks are grouped into groups of size \(7!\), so there are \(12!/7!\) groups.
</p></div></span>
</li>
<li id="li-596">Does your explanation work for numbers other than 12 and 5?  Explain the formula \(P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\) using the variables \(n\) and \(k\).

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-66" id="solution-66"><span class="">Solution</span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-66" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><div class="remark-like"><p id="p-707">
\(P(n,k)\) counts the number of stacks of size \(k\) where the chips come in \(n\) different colors (with at most one chip of each color in the stack). You could count this by first forming all stacks of \(n\) chips, and there are \(n!\) of these. But to get stacks of size \(k\), we don't want the top \(n-k\) chips. When we remove \(n-k\) chips from the stacks, we sometimes get the same arrangement of the bottom chips. In fact, for each arrangement of the bottom \(k\) chips, there are \((n-k)!\) different ways to arrange the top \(n-k\) chips, and all of these should count as just 1 outcome. Thus we divide \(n!\) by \((n-k)!\) to find the number of \(k\)-chip stacks.
