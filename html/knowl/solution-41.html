We saw in \Cref{sec:binom} that the answer to both these questions is \(2^9\), as we can say yes or no (or 0 or 1) to each of the 9 elements in the set (positions in the bit-string). But \(2^9\) also looks like the answer you get from counting functions. In fact, if you count all functions \(f: A \to B\) with \(|A| = 9\) and \(|B| = 2\), this is exactly what you get.
</p>
<p>
This makes sense! Let \(A = \{1,2,\ldots, 9\}\) and \(B = \{y, n\}\). We are assigning each element of the set either a yes or a no. Or in the language of bit-strings, we would take the 9 positions in the bit string as our domain and the set \(\{0,1\}\) as the codomain.
