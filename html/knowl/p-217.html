This works for this one example. Will it always work? Think about what we are doing here. We want to know how many things are either in \(A\) or \(B\) (or both). We can throw in everything in \(A\), and everything in \(B\). This would give \(|A| + |B|\) many elements. But of course when you actually take the union, you do not repeat elements that are in both. So far we have counted every element in \(A \cap B\) exactly twice: once when we put in the elements from \(A\) and once when we included the elements from \(B\). We correct by subtracting out the number of elements we have counted twice. So we added them in twice, subtracted once, leaving them counted only one time.
