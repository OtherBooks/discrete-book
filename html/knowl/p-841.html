So \(N = \frac{46}{99}\). What have we done? We viewed the repeating decimal \(0.464646\ldots\) as a sum of the geometric sequence \(0.46, 0.0046, 0.000046, \ldots\) The common ratio is \(0.01\). The only real difference is that we are now computing an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>infinite</em> geometric sum, we do not have the extra “last” term to consider. Really, this is the result of taking a limit as you would in calculus when you compute <!--Style me with CSS--><em>infinite</em> geometric sums.
