<li id="li-339">\(3^n\), since there are 3 choices for each of the \(n\) digits.</li>
<li id="li-340">\(1\), since all the digits need to be 2's.  However, we might write this as \({n \choose 0}\).</li>
<li id="li-341">There are \({n \choose 1}\) places to put the non-2 digit.  That digit can be either a 0 or a 1, so there are \(2{n \choose 1}\) such strings.</li>
<li id="li-342">We must choose two slots to fill with 0's or 1's.  There are \({n \choose 2}\) ways to do that.  Once the slots are picked, we have two choices for the first slot (0 or 1) and two choices for the second slot (0 or 1).  So there are a total of \(2^2{n \choose 2}\) such strings.</li>
<li id="li-343">There are \({n \choose k}\) ways to pick which slots don't have the 2's.  Then those slots can be filled in \(2^k\) ways (0 or 1 for each slot).  So there are \(2^k{n \choose k}\) such strings.</li>
<li id="li-344">These strings contain just 0's and 1's, so they are bit strings.  There are \(2^n\) bit strings.  But keeping with the pattern above, we might write this as \(2^n {n \choose n}\).</li>
<li id="li-345">We answer the question of how many length \(n\) ternary digit strings there are in two ways.  First, each digit can be one of three choices, so the total number of strings is \(3^n\).  On the other hand, we could break the question down into cases by how many of the digits are 2's.  If they are all 2's, then there are \({n \choose 0}\) strings.  If all but one is a 2, then there are \(2{n \choose 1}\) strings.  If all but 2 of the digits are 2's, then there are \(2^2{n \choose 2}\) strings.  We choose 2 of the \(n\) digits to be non-2, and then there are 2 choices for each of those digits.  And so on for every possible number of 2's in the string.</li>
