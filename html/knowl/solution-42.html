What if we did try to use a function to describe the situation? What should the domain be? It cannot be the 5 friends, because a single element of the domain cannot be mapped to more than one element of the codomain (and we must give away all the games). So the domain is the set of 8 games and the codomain is the set of 5 friends. In this interpretation, assuming that we don't need to give at least one game to each friend, we are just looking for functions, not necessarily injective functions. So the answer would be \(5^8\).

But is this correct? It is if we assume that the 8 games are distinct, or more importantly, that it matters which game goes to which friend. As it turns out, the 8 games you have are all copies of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> (it is a great game after all). Now it really doesn't make sense to think of this as a function, since the domain is not a set of 8 objects. Instead we recognize this as a stars and bars problem, and deduce the answer of \({12 \choose 8}\).
