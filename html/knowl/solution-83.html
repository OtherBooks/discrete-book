Before you say this is impossible, what we are asking for is simply to find a closed formula which agrees with all of the initial terms of the sequences. Of course there is no way to read into the mind of the person who wrote the numbers down, but we can at least do this.
</p>
<p>
Now the first few terms of \gls{Tn}, starting with \(T_1\) are \(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, \ldots\) (these are the triangular numbers). The first few terms of \(a_n\) are \(2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots\). Now let's try to find formulas for the given sequences.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-645">2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, …. Note that if subtract 1 from each term, we get the sequence \(T_n\).  So this sequence is \(T_n + 1\).  Therefore a closed formula is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1\).  A quick check of the first few \(n\) confirms we have it right.</li>
<li id="li-646">2, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33,…. This sequence is the result of adding 1 to each term in \(a_n\).  So we might guess the closed formula \(2^n + 1\).  If we try this though, we get the first terms \(2^1 + 1 = 3\) and \(2^2 + 1 = 5\).  We are off because \(a_n\) started with \(n = 0\) and now we are starting with \(n = 1\).  So we shift: the closed formula is \(2^{n-1} + 1\).</li>
<li id="li-647">2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42,…. Notice that all these terms are even.  What happens if we factor out a 2?  We get \(T_n\)!  So this sequence has closed formula \(n(n+1)\).</li>
<li id="li-648">6, 10, 15, 21, 28, …. These are all triangular numbers.  However, we are starting with 6 as our first term instead of as our third term.  So if we could plug in 3 instead of 1 into the formula for \(T_n\), we would be set.  Therefore the closed formula is \(\frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}\) (where \(n+3\) came from \((n+2)+1\))</li>
<li id="li-649">1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …. Try adding one to each term and we get powers of 2.  You might guess this because each term is approximately twice the previous term.  Closed formula: \(2^{n} - 1\).</li>
<li id="li-650">3, 6, 12, 24, 48, …. These numbers are all multiples of 3.  Let's try dividing each by 3.  Doing so gives 1, 2, 4, 8, ….  Aha.  We get the closed formula \(3\cdot 2^{n-1}\).</li>
<li id="li-651">6, 10, 18, 34, 66, …. To get from one term to the next, we almost double each term.  So maybe we can relate this back to \(2^n\). Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2.  So we get \(2^{n+1} + 2\) (the \(n+1\) is because the first term is 2 more than \(2^2\), not \(2^1\)).  Alternatively, we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, … we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence (omitting the 2).  That sequence had closed formula \(2^{n-1} + 1\).  To make the 3 first, we would write \(2^{n} + 1\).  Our sequence would be twice this, so \(2(2^n + 1)\), which is the same as we got before.</li>
<li id="li-652">15, 33, 57, 87, 123, …. Try dividing each term by 3.  That gives the sequence \(5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots\).  Now add one: \(12, 20, 30, 42, \ldots\), which is sequence 3 in this example, except starting with 6 instead of 2.  So let's start with the formula for sequence 3: \(n(n+1)\).  To start with the 6, we shift: \((n+1)(n+2)\).  But this is one too many, so subtract 1: \((n+1)(n+2) - 1\).  That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3.  So we want \(3((n+1)(n+2) - 1)\).</li>
