How many triangles are there with vertices from the points shown below? Note, we are not allowing degenerate triangles - ones with all three vertices on the same line, but we do allow non-right triangles. Explain why your answer is correct. (HINT: you need at exactly two points on either the \(x\)- or \(y\)-axis, but don't over-count the right triangles.)

There are 120 triangles. Here are two ways (there are others as well) to get this:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-587">First count the triangles with the base on the \(x\)-axis.  There are \({7 \choose 2}\) ways to pick the base.  The third vertex of the triangle must be one of the 4 dots on the \(y\)-axis (not the origin) so there are a total of \({7 \choose 2}4\) of these triangles.  The triangles with base on the \(y\) axis can be counted similarly: \({5 \choose 2}6\).  However, we have counted all the right triangles twice - they have a base on the \(x\)-axis and also on the \(y\)-axis.  There are \(4 \cdot 6\) right triangles.  Thus the total number of triangles is:
\begin{equation*}
  {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4 = 120
\end{equation*}</li>
<li id="li-588">We must select 3 of the 11 dots.  This can be done in \({11 \choose 3}\) ways.  However, this will also give us degenerate triangles when all three vertices are on the \(x\)-axis or on the \(y\)-axis.  There are \({7 \choose 3}\) ways we could have picked all three vertices on the \(x\)-axis.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways we could have picked all three vertices on the \(y\)-axis.  Therefore the total number of triangles is
\begin{equation*}
  {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = 120
\end{equation*}</li>
</ol>
