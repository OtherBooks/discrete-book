<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-120">A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>function</em> is a rule that assigns each element of a set, called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>domain</em>, to exactly one element of a second set, called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>codomain</em>.</li>
<li id="li-121">Notation: \(f:X \to Y\) is our way of saying that the function is called \(f\), the domain is the set \(X\), and the codomain is the set \(Y\).</li>
<li id="li-122">\(f(x) = y\) means the element \(x\) of the domain (input) is assigned to the element \(y\) of the codomain.  We say \(y\) is an output.  Alternatively, we call \(y\) the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>image of \(x\) under \(f\)</em>.</li>
<li id="li-123">The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>range</em> is a subset of the codomain.  It is the set of all elements which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the function.  That is, the range is the set of all outputs.</li>
<li id="li-124">A function is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>injective</em> (an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>injection</em> or <!--Style me with CSS--><em>one-to-one</em>) if every element of the codomain is the output for at most one element from the domain.</li>
<li id="li-125">A function is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>surjective</em> (a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>surjection</em> or <!--Style me with CSS--><em>onto</em>) if every element of the codomain is the output of at least one element of the domain.</li>
<li id="li-126">A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>bijection</em> is a function which is both an injection and surjection.  In other words, if every element of the codomain is the output of exactly one element of the domain.</li>
<li id="li-127">The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>complete inverse image</em> of an element in the codomain, written \(f\inv(y)\), is the set of all elements in the domain which are assigned to \(y\) by the function.</li>
