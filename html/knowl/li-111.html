</h5>\(f\) is not surjective.  There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range.  For example, no \(n \in \Z\) gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that \(\frac{1}{3}\) would be sent to 1, but \(\frac{1}{3}\) is not in the domain).  In fact, the range of the function is \(3\Z\) (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to \(\Z\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_functions.html#li-111">in-context</a></span>
