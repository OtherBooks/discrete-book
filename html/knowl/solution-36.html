First we count all the functions with domain \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) and codomain \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\). For \(f\) to be a function, it must assign each element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain. In other words, we need to assign one of the elements of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\) to \(f(1)\). There are 5 choices for this. Similarly, there are five choices for \(f(2)\). In fact, there are 5 choices for \(f(x)\) for all five possible values of \(x \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}\). Thus the total number of function is \(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 5^5\).

What about the injective (one-to-one) functions? Again, we have 5 choices for \(f(1)\). However, once we assign a value to \(f(1)\), we cannot assign that value to \(f(2)\), or any other \(f(x)\). So for each of the 5 choices for \(f(1)\), we only have 4 choices for \(f(2)\), and then only 3 choices for \(f(3)\) and only 2 choices for \(f(4)\), leaving only 1 choice (the last element of the codomain) for \(f(5)\). Therefore the number of one-to-one functions is \(5!\).
