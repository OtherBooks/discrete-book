<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-111">\(f\) is not surjective.  There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range.  For example, no \(n \in \Z\) gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that \(\frac{1}{3}\) would be sent to 1, but \(\frac{1}{3}\) is not in the domain).  In fact, the range of the function is \(3\Z\) (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to \(\Z\).</li>
<li id="li-112">\(g\) is not surjective.  There is no \(x \in \{1,2,3\}\) (the domain) for which \(g(x) = b\),  so \(b\), which is in the codomain, is not in the range.</li>
<li id="li-113">\(h\) is surjective.  Every element of the codomain is also in the range.  Nothing in the codomain is missed.</li>
