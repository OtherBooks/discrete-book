This problem is just like giving 13 cookies to 5 kids. We need to say how many of the 13 units go to each of the 5 variables. In other words, we have 13 stars and 4 bars (the bars are like the “+” signs in the equation).
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-355">If \(x_i\) can be 0 or greater, we are in the standard case with no restrictions.  So 13 stars and 4 bars can be arranged in \({17 \choose 4}\) ways.</li>
<li id="li-356">Now each variable must be at least 1.  So give one unit to each variable to satisfy that restriction.  Now there are 8 stars left, and still 4 bars, so the number of solutions is \({12 \choose 4}\).</li>
<li id="li-357">Now each variable must be 2 or greater.  So before any counting, give each variable 2 units.  We now have 3 remaining stars and 4 bars, so there are \({7 \choose 4}\) solutions.</li>
</ol>
