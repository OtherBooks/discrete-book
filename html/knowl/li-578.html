</h5>Start finding sums of digits from 3-digit numbers: \(100 \to\) odd, \(101 \to\) even, \(102 \to\)odd, \(103 \to\) even, and so on.  So the numbers appear to alternate between even and odd sums.  However, notice that 109 has an even sum while 110 does as well.  But then 111 is odd, 112 is even, and so on.  So we can conclude that half of the numbers 100 to 109 have even sum, half of the number 110 to 119 have even sum, half from 120 to 129, and so on.  This means that overall half of the numbers will have even sum, so half of the 900 3-digit numbers will have even sum, namely 450 of them.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_count-conc.html#li-578">in-context</a></span>
