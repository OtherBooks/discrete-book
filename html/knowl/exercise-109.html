Suppose you planned on giving 7 gold stars to some of the 13 star students in your class. Each student can receive at most one star. How many ways can you do this? Use PIE, and also an easier method, and compare your results.

<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-answer-86" id="answer-86"><span class="heading"><span class="type">Answer</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-answer-86" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><p id="p-558">
Without any restriction, there would be \({19\choose 12}\) ways to distribute the stars. Now we must use PIE to eliminate all distributions in which one or more student gets more than one star:
\begin{equation*}
  {19 \choose 12} - \left[{13 \choose 1}{17 \choose 12} - {13\choose 2}{15 \choose 12} + {13\choose 3}{13 \choose 12}\right] = 1716.
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p id="p-559">
Interestingly enough, this number is also the value of \({13 \choose 7}\), which makes sense: if each student can have at most one star, we must just pick the 7 out of 13 students to receive them.
