With all the different counting techniques we have mastered in this last chapter, it might be difficult to know when to apply which technique. Indeed, it is very easy to get mixed up and use the wrong counting method for a given problem. You get better with practice. As you practice you start to notice some trends that can help you distinguish between types of counting problems. Here are some suggestions that you might find helpful when deciding how to tackle a counting problem and checking whether your solution is correct.
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-446">Remember that you are counting the number of items in some <!--Style me with CSS--><em>list of outcomes</em>.  Write down part of this list.  Write down an element in the middle of the list – how are you deciding whether your element really is in the list.  Could you get this element more than once using your proposed answer?</li>
<li id="li-447">If generating an element on the list involves selecting something (for example, picking a letter or picking a position to put a letter, etc), can the things you select be repeated?  Remember, permutations and combinations select objects from a set <!--Style me with CSS--><em>without</em> repeats.</li>
<li id="li-448">Does order matter?  Be careful here and be sure you know what your answer really means.  We usually say that order matters when you get different outcomes when the same objects are selected in different orders.  Combinations and “Stars &amp; Bars” are used when order <!--Style me with CSS--><em>does not</em> matter.</li>
<li id="li-449">There are four possibilities when it comes to order and repeats.  If order matters and repeats are allowed, the answer will look like \(n^k\).  If order matters and repeats are not allowed, we have \(P(n,k)\).  If order doesn't matter and repeats are allowed, use stars and bars.  If order doesn't matter and repeats are not allowed, use \({n\choose k}\).  But be careful: this only applies when you are selecting things, and you should make sure you know exactly what you are selecting before determining which case you are in.</li>
<li id="li-450">Think about how you would represent your counting problem in terms of sets or functions.  We know how to count different sorts of sets and different types of functions.</li>
<li id="li-451">As we saw with combinatorial proofs, you can often solve a counting problem in more than one way.  Do that, and compare your numerical answers.  If they don't match, something is amiss.</li>
</ul>
<p id="p-621">
While we have covered many counting techniques, we have really only scratched the surface of the large subject of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>enumerative combinatorics</em>. There are mathematicians doing original research in this area even as you read this. Counting can be really hard.
</p>
<p id="p-622">
In the next chapter, we will approach counting questions from a very different direction, and in doing so, answer infinitely many counting questions at the same time. We will create <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sequences</em> of answers to related questions.

We usually write numbers in decimal form (or base 10), meaning numbers are composed using 10 different “digits” \(\{0,1,\ldots, 9\}\). Sometimes though it is useful to write numbers <!--Style me with CSS--><em>hexadecimal</em> or base 16. Now there are 16 distinct digits that can be used to form numbers: \(\{0, 1, \ldots, 9, \mathrm{A, B, C, D, E, F}\}\). So for example, a 3 digit hexadecimal number might be 3B8.

There are 16 hexadecimals in which the first digit is an E (one for each choice of second digit). Similarly, there are 16 hexadecimals in which the first digit is an F. We want the union of these two disjoint sets, so there are \(16 + 16 = 32\) two digits hexadecimals in which the first digit is either an E or an F.

We can first select the first digit in 2 ways. We then select the second digit in 16 ways. The multiplicative principle says that the number of ways to accomplish both these tasks together is \(2 \cdot 16 = 32\). Of course \(2 \cdot 16 = 16 + 16\) so we get the same answer as in part (a). There we divided the total number of outcomes into two groups of size 16, each group based on the choice we made for the first task (selecting the first digit).

We want all the elements from both these sets. However, both sets include those 3-digit hexadecimals which both start with a letter and end with a numeral (found to be 960 in the previous part), so we must subtract these (once).

<p id="p-676">
There are multiple ways to do this.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-576">An even sum can occur in 4 ways: EEE, EOO, OEO, and OOE.  There are \(4 \cdot 5 \cdot 5\) ways to build numbers of the first two types (there are only 4 choices for a starting even number - it cannot be 0) and \(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5\) ways to build the second two types.  This gives a total of 450 numbers.</li>
<li id="li-577">To build a 3 digit number with an even sum, you can choose any of 9 digits for the first digit, any of 10 digits for the second digit.  Then the last digit must either be even (if the sum of the first two digits are even) or odd (if the sum of the first two digits are odd).  Luckily there are the same number of even last digits and odd last digits - 5.  So there are a total of \(9 \cdot 10 \cdot 5 = 450\) numbers with an even sum of digits.</li>
<li id="li-578">Start finding sums of digits from 3-digit numbers: \(100 \to\) odd, \(101 \to\) even, \(102 \to\)odd, \(103 \to\) even, and so on.  So the numbers appear to alternate between even and odd sums.  However, notice that 109 has an even sum while 110 does as well.  But then 111 is odd, 112 is even, and so on.  So we can conclude that half of the numbers 100 to 109 have even sum, half of the number 110 to 119 have even sum, half from 120 to 129, and so on.  This means that overall half of the numbers will have even sum, so half of the 900 3-digit numbers will have even sum, namely 450 of them.</li>

There are 120 triangles. Here are two ways (there are others as well) to get this:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-587">First count the triangles with the base on the \(x\)-axis.  There are \({7 \choose 2}\) ways to pick the base.  The third vertex of the triangle must be one of the 4 dots on the \(y\)-axis (not the origin) so there are a total of \({7 \choose 2}4\) of these triangles.  The triangles with base on the \(y\) axis can be counted similarly: \({5 \choose 2}6\).  However, we have counted all the right triangles twice - they have a base on the \(x\)-axis and also on the \(y\)-axis.  There are \(4 \cdot 6\) right triangles.  Thus the total number of triangles is:
\begin{equation*}
  {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4 = 120
\end{equation*}</li>
<li id="li-588">We must select 3 of the 11 dots.  This can be done in \({11 \choose 3}\) ways.  However, this will also give us degenerate triangles when all three vertices are on the \(x\)-axis or on the \(y\)-axis.  There are \({7 \choose 3}\) ways we could have picked all three vertices on the \(x\)-axis.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways we could have picked all three vertices on the \(y\)-axis.  Therefore the total number of triangles is

There are \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\cdot 9\cdot 8 = 95040\) different stacks of 5 chips.

Say you made all \(12!\) stacks of 12 chips. For any particular arrangement of the bottom 5 chips, you will have \(7!\) stacks that have that bottom arrangement (one for each arrangement of the remaining 7 chips). But we just want to count the number of 5-chip stacks, so we count all of these as the same outcome (once the top 7 chips are removed, the bottom stacks look identical). Thus we really want to count how many groups there are. All \(12!\) stacks are grouped into groups of size \(7!\), so there are \(12!/7!\) groups.

\(P(n,k)\) counts the number of stacks of size \(k\) where the chips come in \(n\) different colors (with at most one chip of each color in the stack). You could count this by first forming all stacks of \(n\) chips, and there are \(n!\) of these. But to get stacks of size \(k\), we don't want the top \(n-k\) chips. When we remove \(n-k\) chips from the stacks, we sometimes get the same arrangement of the bottom chips. In fact, for each arrangement of the bottom \(k\) chips, there are \((n-k)!\) different ways to arrange the top \(n-k\) chips, and all of these should count as just 1 outcome. Thus we divide \(n!\) by \((n-k)!\) to find the number of \(k\)-chip stacks.

Question: How many ways can you select a chaired committee of \(k\) people from a group of \(n\) people? That is, you need to select \(k\) people to be on the committee and one of them needs to be in charge. How many ways can this happen?

<p id="p-715">
Answer 1: First select \(k\) of the \(n\) people to be on the committee. This can be done in \({n \choose k}\) ways. Now select one of those \(k\) people to be in charge - this can be done in \(k\) ways. So there are a total of \(k {n \choose k}\) ways to select the chaired committee.

Answer 2: First select the chair of the committee. You have \(n\) people to choose from, so this can be done in \(n\) ways. Now fill the rest of the committee. There are \(n-1\) people to choose from (you cannot select the person you picked to be the chair) and \(k-1\) spots to fill (the chair's spot is already taken). So this can be done in \({n-1 \choose k-1}\) ways. Therefore there are \(n{n-1 \choose k-1}\) ways to select the chaired committee.
