Hopefully this chapter has given you some sense for the wide variety of graph theory topics as well as why these studies are interesting. There are many more interesting areas to consider and the list is increasing all the time; graph theory is an active area of mathematical research.
</p>
<p id="p-1875">
One reason graph theory is such a rich area of study is that it deals with such a fundamental concept: any pair of objects can either be related or not related. What the objects are and what “related” means varies on context, and this leads to many applications of graph theory to science and other areas of math. The objects can be countries, and two countries can be related if they share a border. The objects could be land masses which are related if there is a bridge between them. The objects could be websites which are related if there is a link from one to the other. Or we can be completely abstract: the objects are vertices which are related if their is an edge between them.
</p>
<p id="p-1876">
What question we ask about the graph depends on the application, but often leads to deeper, general and abstract questions worth studying in their own right. Here is a short summary of the types of questions we have considered:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-1128">Can the graph be drawn in the plane without edges crossing?  If so, how many regions does this drawing divide the plane into?</li>
<li id="li-1129">Is it possible to color the vertices of the graph so that related vertices have different colors using a small number of colors?  How many colors are needed?</li>
<li id="li-1130">Is it possible to trace over every edge of a graph exactly once without lifting up your pencil?  What other sorts of “paths” might a graph posses?</li>
<li id="li-1131">Can you find subgraphs with certain properties?  For example, when does a (bipartite) graph contain a subgraph in which all vertices are only related to one other vertex?</li>
</ul>
<p id="p-1877">
Not surprisingly, these questions are often related to each other. For example, the chromatic number of a graph cannot be greater than 4 when the graph is planar. Whether the graph has an Euler path depends on how many vertices each vertex is adjacent to (and whether those numbers are always even or not). Even the existence of matchings in bipartite graphs can be proved using paths.

<li id="li-1147">No.  The 9 triangles each contribute 3 edges, and the 6 pentagons contribute 5 edges.  This gives a total of 57, which is exactly twice the number of edges, since each edge borders exactly 2 faces.  But 57 is odd, so this is impossible.</li>
<li id="li-1148">Now adding up all the edges of all the 16 polygons gives a total of 64, meaning there would be 32 edges in the polyhedron.  We can then use Euler's formula \(v - e + f = 2\) to deduce that there must be 18 vertices.</li>
<li id="li-1149">If you add up all the vertices from each polygon separately, we get a total of 64.  This is not divisible by 3, so it cannot be that each vertex belongs to exactly 3 faces.  Could they all belong to 4 faces?  That would mean there were \(64/4 = 16\) vertices, but we know from Euler's formula that there must be 18 vertices.  We can write \(64 = 3x + 4y\) and solve for \(x\) and \(y\) (as integers).  We get that there must be 10 vertices with degree 4 and 8 with degree 3. (Note the number of faces joined at a vertex is equal to its degree in graph theoretic terms.)</li>

For all these questions, we are really coloring the vertices of a graph. You get the graph by first drawing a planar representation of the polyhedron and then taking its planar dual: put a vertex in the center of each face (including the outside) and connect two vertices if their faces share an edge.
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-1153">Since the planar dual of a dodecahedron contains a 5-wheel, it's chromatic number is at least 4.  Alternatively, suppose you could color the faces using 3 colors without any two adjacent faces colored the same.  Take any face and color it blue.  The 5 pentagons bordering this blue pentagon cannot be colored blue.  Color the first one red.  Its two neighbors (adjacent to the blue pentagon) get colored green.  The remaining 2 cannot be blue or green, but also cannot both be red since they are adjacent to each other.  Thus a 4th color is needed.</li>
<li id="li-1154">The planar dual of the dodecahedron is itself a planar graph.  Thus be the 4-color theorem, it can be colored using only 4 colors without two adjacent vertices (corresponding to the faces of the polyhedron) being colored identically.</li>

Recall that in order for \(f\) to define an isomorphism between \(G1\) and \(G2\), it must preserve relationships between vertices. To put this into context, this means that since \(a\) and \(b\) are joined via an edge in \(G1\) that their corresponding vertices in \(G2\) must also be joined by an edge. This must be true for all of the vertices and edges. When examining the function, we can see that the vertex \(g\) goes to \(v_7\), that is \(f(g)=v_7\). BUT, \(g\) has exactly 2 edges (so \(g\) is degree 2) and \(v_7\) is degree 3. This means that \(f\) cannot possibly be an isomorphism. Similarly, we can see that \(f\) does not take \(c\) to the correct vertex either \(c\) is degree 2 and \(v_1\) has degree 3.

No, it could not possibly be isomorphic. If you count up the degrees of each vertex in this picture, you can see that the highest degree is 4 (the center vertex). In order to be isomorphic to either \(G1\) or \(G2\) we would definitely need a vertex of degree 5, which we don't have.

Since there are 8 triangles, there must be 8 faces. We can count the number of edges by taking \(8 \cdot 3 = 24\), but this is double counting since each edge corresponds to two faces.

Well, right off we know that the truncated icosahedron has \(12+20=32\) faces by counting the number of pentagons and hexagons. Now, because we know that every connected planar graph with \(V\) vertices, \(E\) edges and \(F\) faces satisfied \(V - E + F = 2\), we only really need to find out the number of edges or the number of vertices since \(V-E=-30\). So, let's maybe try to figure out the number of edges we have. If we think about the number of total edges when the pentagons and hexagons are not attached, we know that we have \(5\times 12+6\times 20=180\). But each of these edges is shared with another edge, which means that we have cut the number of edges in half. So, we have \(90\) edges, which then gives us \(60\) vertices.

Now, using the hint, we also know that \(3V\leq F\) but \(3\times 29\) is not in fact less than \(15\). So we have a contradiction, and your friend is lying.

Suppose, for contradiction, that the Petersen graph were planar. Then it would satisfy Euler's formula: \(V - E + F = 2\). Since the graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges, this says that there must be \(7\) faces.
</p>
<p id="p-1928">
Now let \(B\) be the total number of boundaries around all faces when the graph is drawn in a planar way. Since each edge is used in two boundaries we have \(B = 2E\). On the other hand, each face is surrounded by <!--Style me with CSS--><em>at least</em> 5 boundaries, since the shortest cycle (circuit) in the graph contains 5 edges. Thus \(F \le \frac{B}{5}\). Putting these two facts together we get
\begin{equation*}
  F \le \frac{2E}{5}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p id="p-1929">
This is a contradiction, since \(7 \not\le \frac{2\cdot 30}{6}\). Alternatively, the above relationship says that \(F \le 6\), but we said \(F = 7\) above.

Assume for a contradiction that every tree with at least 3 vertices does not have a leaf. Namely, that there are no vertices of degree 1. Then, every vertex must have a degree of 2 or more, but this would imply that we have a cycle! Why? Think about taking a path from one vertex to another. Choose the first vertex and a route to leave it (remember it should have at least two ways to leave). Once I leave that vertex I reach another vertex which also has at least one more way to leave.

Let \(T_{k+1}\) be a tree graph with \(k+1\) vertices. By part (b) we know that every tree with at least 3 vertices has a leaf, so cut that one leaf off of \(T_{k+1}\).

Yes, he must start in the top right room and end in the bottom middle room, or vice versa. This is because those are the two rooms with an odd number of doors.
</p>
<p id="p-1938">
In graph theory terms, if we place a vertex in each room and connect vertices if there is a door between their rooms, we are asking whether the graph has an Euler path. The number of doors is the degree of the vertex, and a graph has an Euler path if and only if there are two or fewer vertices with odd degree. In that case, the path must start at one of those odd degree vertices and end at the other.
</p>
</div></span>

Yes. This does not correspond to an Euler path or circuit, since all we need to do is visit each vertex exactly once. It is easy to do - for example, tour the house clockwise.

<p id="p-1940">
No it is not possible. If each room had an odd number of doors, then the corresponding graph would have the property that the degree of every vertex would be odd. There are 7 vertices, and if their degrees were all odd, then the sum of the degrees would be an odd number as well. But the number of edges in a graph is always 1/2 the sum of the degrees, so the sum of the degrees must be even.
</p>
<p id="p-1941">
In other words, if you add up the number of doors in all rooms, you need to get an even number, since the number of doorways is half this number - each doorway counts as a door in two rooms.

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement “A tree with \(n\) vertices has a chromatic number of 2”
Base Case: Consider a tree with \(3\) vertices. Since trees cannot have a cycle and two of the vertices are adjacent to the third vertex, we must have a coloring with 2 colors.
Inductive Case: Assume that \(P(k)\) is true for some arbitrary \(k\lt n\). Now, I need to show that \(P(k+1)\) is true. So, I can assume that I have a tree with \(k+1\) vertices and I must show that it has chromatic number 2. Now, if I remove one of leaf from the tree with \(k+1\) vertices I will be removing exactly 1 edge and 1 vertex. Therefore I have a tree with \(k\) vertices which I know by my inductive hypothesis must have a chromatic number of 2. Now, I can add that leaf back in, and since it's only attached to exactly one vertex which is colored one of the 2 colors, I can color the added vertex the opposite color and still have a chromatic number of 2.
