discrete-book
=============

An open textbook for Discrete Mathematics, as taught at the University of Northern Colorado.  More information about the project is available on [the book's main website](http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com).

## Fall 2015 corrected edition

This current branch (Fall2015-corrected) contains the source files for the corrected version of the Fall 2015 edition.  Use this in case you have that edition or want to continue using that edition.  Most people will want to wait for the Fall 2016 edition, which will be released in early August.  For progress on this, see the development branch.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile, compile the file "discretebook.tex" using pdfLaTeX or similar.  If you would prefer to have margins more suitable for printing and binding (specifically two-sided), compile "discretebook-print.tex"

In case you would like to grab just single chapters or exercise sets, you *should* be able to compile each of those idividually as well (thanks to the DocMute package).

## Contributing

Any and all suggestions to improve the text are welcome.  Thanks to those who have already pointed out typos/issues they have found.  If you would like to make a more substantial contribution, please contact me so we can discuss how best to proceed.

## ToDo

Over the next few months (May to August 2016) I plan to convert the project to MathBookXML as well as make other improvements.  A new edition will be available for the Fall 2016 semester.
